1. Local repository (repo) => our laptop/computer
   Remote repo => git

2. changes in git language means => commit

3. Configuring Git (means telling Git with which account and username we want to commit changes)
   git config --global user.name "give username"
   git config --global user.email "someone@email.com" (there two ways of configuration: local and global)
   git config --list  (to see details stored in git config)

4. Clone - Cloning a repository on our local machine to work 
   git clone <project link>

5. status - displays the state of the code
   git status

6. There are 4 status of any file in git :-

   untracked -
   new files that git doesn't yet track (new file)

   modified - 
   changed

   staged - 
   file is ready to be committed

   unmodified - 
   unchanged

7. after modify there is two step process :-
   modify -> add -> commit

8. change (modified) / created newfile (untracked)  --> add (staged) --> commit (unchanged)

9. add - adds new or changed files in your working directory to the Git staging area
   git add <file name> (use 'git restore --staged <file name>' instead of 'add' to unstage)

   commit - it is the record of change
   git commit -m "add some message"
